This is a Django / React website built using the tutorial https://blog.logrocket.com/using-react-django-create-app-tutorial/ .

It has been modified so that it can connect to a stock api, fetch the price of either Google, Amazon, Microsoft or Apple, convert the price from USD to DKK and store the result in a database and API using Django.
